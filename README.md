# Knights Travails

## PROBLEM
Given enough turns, a knight on a standard 8x8 chess board can move from any square to any other square. Its basic move is two steps forward and one step to the side or one step forward and two steps to the side. It can face any direction.

## HOW I SOLVED THIS PROBLEM
Using graphs

I imagine the chess board as a directed graph, with each square being a vertex in that graph.

Because, given a particular square on a chess board, a knight on that square can only move to a specific set of boxes from there.

With that in mind, here's how I approached solving this problem step-by-step ðŸ‘‡

### STEP 1
Build an array of 64 arrays (i.e. adjacency lists). Each of the 64 arrays will be a pair of values (e.g. [x, y]) with the first value referring to the row number (starting from 1), and the second value referring to the column number (starting from 1).

### STEP 2
Build an array of 64 adjacency lists.

### STEP 3
Write a function to get the index of a chess board coordinate in the chessBoardVertices array.

### STEP 4
